<!-- more --> 
<p>  These days, I'm learning Java by watching videoes. Though I'd been learning Java for half a year, but meanwhile I was preparing my college entrance exam. so I could not concentrate on programming. I think it is necessary to have a review because in next term I'm going to attend Java class which is taught in Japanese.<br>
  It's kind of a difficult stuff that learning something in three languages. I'm trying to review what I have learned by using a book called 'Head First Java', the English version.<br>

 整个暑假都在折腾英语和Java了....最近打算把汇编的书看一看，提前预习免得下学期忙不过来</p>

<p> This is the first article I have written to celebrate the opening of my personal blog which at last ran successfully in 20190821. I'm going to use it as a technology blog and put any note on it which is important in programming or anything else computer involved.<br>
 I'll try my best to write articles in English. I hope this is a good challenge and a good chance to prove my proficiency in English.<br>
 Never Stop Learning.<br>
 厚积薄发。</p>
